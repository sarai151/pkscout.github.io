This is similar to how Zip works, except with FLAC you will get much better compression because it is designed specifically for audio, and you can play back compressed FLAC files in your favorite player (or your car or home stereo, see supported devices) just like you would an MP3 file.\n\nFLAC stands out as the fastest and most widely supported lossless audio codec, and the only one that at once is non-proprietary, is unencumbered by patents, has an open-source reference implementation, has a well documented format and API, and has several other independent implementations.","disclaimer":null,"fanarts":null,"featured":null,"firstseen":"September 07, 2020","forum":null,"icon":"/images/addons/audioencoder.flac/icon.png","lastupdate":"September 07, 2020","license":"GPL-2.0-or-later","name":"Flac Audio Encoder","news":null,"platforms":[{"path":"https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/xbmc/addons/matrix/audioencoder.flac+android-armv7/audioencoder.flac-3.0.0.zip","platform":"android-armv7"},{"path":"https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/xbmc/addons/matrix/audioencoder.flac+osx-x86_64/audioencoder.flac-3.0.0.zip","platform":"osx-x86_64"},{"path":"https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/xbmc/addons/matrix/audioencoder.flac+windows-x86_64/audioencoder.flac-3.0.0.zip","platform":"windows-x86_64"},{"path":"https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/xbmc/addons/matrix/audioencoder.flac+windows-i686/audioencoder.flac-3.0.0.zip","platform":"windows-i686"},{"path":"https://ftp.halifax.rwth-aachen.de/xbmc/addons/matrix/audioencoder.flac+android-aarch64/audioencoder.flac-3.0.0.zip","platform":"android-aarch64"}],"screenshots":null,"size":"172KB","source":"https://github.com/xbmc/audioencoder.flac","summary":"FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) Encoder","version":"3.0.0","website":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"audioencoder.flac"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2275478776"]}
