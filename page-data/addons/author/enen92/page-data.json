Trial and error will get you so far, but the best way to learn is to watch an experienced Vim user at work. By providing short videos with digestible advice, Vimcasts gives you something you can take away and use immediately to improve your productivity. Vimcasts aims to be the expert Vim colleague you never had.[CR][CR]Vimcasts is produced by Drew Neil (aka nelstrom), who came to Vim from TextMate.
